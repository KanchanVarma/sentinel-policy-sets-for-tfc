# Sentinel Policy Sets For Use With Terraform Cloud
This repository contains Sentinel [policy sets](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/manage-policies.html) for use with Terraform Cloud.

There are four policy sets, one each for AWS, Azure, GCP, and VMware. The first three each contain two policies that restrict the size of VMs and require specific tags or labels.  The fourth contains a single policy that restricts the CPU and memory allocated to VMs.
